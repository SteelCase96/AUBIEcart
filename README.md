# Version 1.0
Deployed and tested on Friday, November 15th. Some modifications were made to correct some errors noted in testing. This program is currently capable of:
* Reading the state of a joystick.
* Determing the appropriate speed and direction for two motors from the state of the joystick.
* Driving the motors.
* Transmitting data wirelessly to a 'console' via an HC-12 transciever.
